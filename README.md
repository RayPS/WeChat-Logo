# WeChat Logo

**Unofficial but 99% similarity**

[DIFF between original icon](https://github.com/RayPS/WeChat-Logo/commit/39c44a8db61d4f0131288fba1caf8bb3e4464362?diff=unified) from [AppStore](http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/5e/83/b5/5e83b50a-5472-a528-cbc9-263b73d12324/icon1024x1024.png)

Why:

Because we need to use the icon in our Apps (especially the social sharing part).
And they don't provide an offical one for designers and developers.

P.S: If you are looking for the logo of _**Weibo**_ you can [get it here from the official page](http://weibo.com/static/logo).
